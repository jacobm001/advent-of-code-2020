### Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions to the advent of code 2020 challenge. I'm planning on using Python to complete the puzzles this year. 

### Goals

1. Use as much native Python as possible. All standard library functions are fair game, but I'm going to challenge myself to use as few external libraries as possible.
2. Reuse as much code as possible. This should be good practice to write code that is generic, without being overly complex.
3. Test everything. As many developers, I don't always test as much as I should. This is a great opportunity to try more advanced testing procedures.
